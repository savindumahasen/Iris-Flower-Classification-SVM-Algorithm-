# Iris-Flower-Classification-SVM-Algorithm-
This project is created using mainly SVM (Support Vector Machine) Algorithm. For completing this project I used the kaggle website iris dataset. And as well as different kind of matrics are used like accuracy, f1-score, confusion matrix, classification_report.
